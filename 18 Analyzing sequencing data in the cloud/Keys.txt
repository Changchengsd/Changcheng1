Q. How would you check that these files with extension ‘.fastq’ actually look like what we expect for a FASTQ file? You could try printing the first few lines to the shell standard output:

On AWS
# Fill in the blank!
head SRR2156848 1.fastq

Q. How could you check the number of sequences in each file?

On AWS
# Fill in the blanks
$ grep -c "@SRR2156848" SRR2156848_1.fastq 
2959900

Check you have pairs of FASTQ files for all four datasets.
On AWS
# fill in the blank
head *.fastq

# Unzip and Untar the resulting file
tar -zxvf kallisto_linux-v0.44.0.tar.gz
